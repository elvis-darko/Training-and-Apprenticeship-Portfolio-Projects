## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In this project, We analyze funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. Data for each year of funding is located in a separate csv file in the dataset provided. In these files are the start-ups' details, the funding amounts received, and the investors' information.

As the Data Analyst for this project, We will develop a null and alternate hypothesis,  ask business questions, explore the datasets, clean and prepare the datasets, analyze the final prepared dataset and tell compelling stories with intuitive and appropraite visulaizations.

## SETUP
It is recommended to have a Jupyter notebook or any other standard code editor on your local machine.<br />Install the required packages locally to your computer.

It is recommended that you run a python version above 3.0. 
You can download the required python version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Use these recommended steps to set up your local machine for this project:

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment :** <br />This will isolate the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts.<br />Choose any of the line of code that will work on your local machine.

            python3 -m venv venv
            python -m venv venv


2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment :**<br />This will ensure that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the created isolated environment.

            - for windows : 
                         venv\Scripts\activate

            - for Linux & MacOS :
                         source venv/bin/activate


3. **Upgrade Pip :**<br />Pip is the installed libraries/packages manager. Upgrading Pip will give an to up-to-date version that will work correctly.

            python -m pip install --upgrade pip


4. **Install the required libraries/packages :**<br />There are libraries and packages that are required for this project. These libraries and packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.<br />The text file will allow you to import these libraries and packages into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

            python -m pip install -r requirements.txt 


## TEAM ZURICH
As part of the requirements for the training and apprenticeship program, this project was undertaken by a team of six(6) data analysts from different countries.<br />Together, we formed Team Zurich. The project was undertaken with high collaboration, dedication and research.<br />The team regularly met on Microsoft Teams and used WhatsApp Messenger for direct messaging outside meeting times. 

The Team Lead was Elvis Darko(me).

The Members of Team Zurich were;

- Elvis Darko                     -   Ghana

- Richmond Elikplim Yao Abake     -   Ghana

- Joseph Gikubu                   -   Kenya

- Faith Berida                    -   Nigeria

- Aliyyah Adebayo                 -  Nigeria

- Yollam Chilenje Manda           -   Malawi
