## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In this project, We analyze funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. Data for each year of funding is located in a separate csv file in the dataset provided. In these files are the start-ups' details, the funding amounts received, and the investors' information.

As the Data Analyst for this project, We will develop a null and alternate hypothesis,  ask business questions, explore the datasets, clean and prepare the datasets, analyze the final prepared dataset and tell compelling stories with intuitive and appropraite visulaizations.



## SUMMARY





## SETUP
Install the required packages locally to your computer.

It is recommended that you run a python version above 3.0. 
You can download the required python version ["here"]((https://www.python.org/)).

Use these recommended steps to set up your local machine for this project:

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment** 
This will isolate the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;

python3 -m venv venv


2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment** 
This will ensure that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the created isolated environment;

- for windows : 
            venv\Scripts\activate

- for Linux & MacOS :
            source venv/bin/activate


3. **Upgrade Pip** 
Pip is the installed libraries/packages manager. Upgrading Pip will give an to up-to-date version that will work correctly;

python -m pip install --upgrade pip


4. **Install the required libraries/packages** 
There are libraries and packages that are required for this project. These libraries and packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. The text file will allow you to import these libraries and packages into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
