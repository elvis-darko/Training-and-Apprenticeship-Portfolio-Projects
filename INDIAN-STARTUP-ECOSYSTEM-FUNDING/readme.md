## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In this project, I analyze funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. Data for each year of funding is located in a separate csv file in the dataset provided. In these files are the start-ups' details, the funding amounts received, and the investors' information.

As the Data Analyst for this project, I will develop a null and alternate hypothesis,  ask business questions, explore the datasets, clean and prepare the datasets, analyze the final prepared dataset and tell compelling stories with intuitive and appropraite visulaizations.
