## RECOMMENDATIONS
From our careful study of the datasets and our analysis, these are our recommendations as Data Analysts of the company.

The Indian start-up ecosystem is experiencing an increasing momentum. The timing for penetration into the ecosystem is right. 

From our analysis, the trend of funding has been increasing at a steady rate. With a total number of startups funded for the recorded period being 2200, the average amount a startup is likely to receive as total funding is US$ 127,319,293.98. This means that competition for funding is not very intense. Investors are ready to invest in promising startups.

We therefore recommend the following;

- The company should consider establishing in Bengaluru, Mumbai, New Delhi and Gurgaon. These cities have the most startups. A startup in these cities is also likely to receive significant amount of funding.


- The company is right to seek funding in the early stages. Most investors favored investing during the Seed and Series A rounds. The average amount our company is likely to recieve as seed fund is US$ 1,457,246.19.


- The company should consider seeking funding from Sequoia Capital, Inflection Point Ventures, Venture Catalysts, Silver Lake, Mumbai Angel Network and Salesforce Ventures. These investors invested in a couple of startups and raised higher amount of funds.


- The company should consider establishing a startup in Fintech, Retail, E-commerce and EdTech as these sectors are most favored by investors with higher number of investments and huge inflow of funds.
