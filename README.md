The table below shows the names, description, status and tools used for projects.

| S/N | PROJECT NAME | DESCRIPTION | STATUS | ARTICLE |
|-----|--------------|-------------|---------|-------|
|[LP1](https://github.com/elvis-darko/Training-and-Apprenticeship-Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/INDIAN-STARTUP-ECOSYSTEM-FUNDING)|     [Indian Start-up Ecosystem Funding - Data Analysis Project](https://github.com/elvis-darko/Training-and-Apprenticeship-Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/INDIAN-STARTUP-ECOSYSTEM-FUNDING)        |  This Project analyzes funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. Analysis is made in a Jupyter notebook. Microsoft Power BI is used for insights visualizations       |  Completed      |  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7050151401053708288/)<br />[Medium](https://medium.com/@el.darkoel/the-indian-start-up-ecosystem-an-analysis-of-funding-d234f84f13bb)|
|[LP2](https://github.com/elvis-darko/Training-and-Apprenticeship-Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/STORE-SALES-TIME-SERIES-FORECASTING)| [Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting - Regression Project](https://github.com/elvis-darko/Training-and-Apprenticeship-Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/STORE-SALES-TIME-SERIES-FORECASTING)           |    In this time series forecasting project, I predict store sales on data from Corporation Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer. Specifically, I build a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores       | Completed      |  [Medium](https://medium.com/@el.darkoel/time-series-analysis-ddcdda3ab54)    |
|LP3|     [Telecommunication Customer Attrition - Classification Project](https://github.com/elvis-darko/Training-and-Apprenticeship-Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/TELCO-CUSTOMER-CHURN)         |     In this Classification Project, I aim to find the likelihood of a customer leaving the company, the key indicators of churn as well as the retention strategies that can be implemented to avert this problem        |Completed  |   [Medium](https://medium.com/@el.darkoel/telecommunication-customer-churn-70414d85c97c)   |
|LP4|     [Embedding Machine Learning Model into GUI](https://github.com/elvis-darko/Training-and-Apprenticeship-Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/EMBEDDING%20ML%20MODEL%20INTO%20GUI)         |       In this project, I will embed the already-built models from the Regression and Classification projects into a Graphic User Interface (GUI). These machine learning model will be integrated into an existing production environment to make practical business decisions based on data.      |  Completed       |    Medium   |
|LP5|   The Sentiment Analysis Project           |   In this project, I finetune a pre-trained machine learning model to assess if a Twitter post related to vaccinations is positive, neutral, or negative. This solution could help governments and other public health actors monitor public sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccinations and help improve public health policy, vaccine communication strategies, and vaccination programs across the world.<br />This project serves as an introduction to Unstructured data exploitation, especially Natural Language Processing data, using ML.<br />The fine-tuned machine learning model will be used to used to create a Gradio app that will be hosted on Hugging Face.          |  Yet To Start       |  Medium     |
|LP6|        Embedding Machine Learning Model into a Web Application      |             |  Yet To Start       |   Medium    |
