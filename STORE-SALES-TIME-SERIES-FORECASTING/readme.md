## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In this time series forecasting project, I predict store sales on data from Corporation Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer. 

Specifically, I build a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores

## SETUP
It is recommended to have a Jupyter Noteotebook or any other standard code editor on your local machine.<br />Install the required packages locally to your computer.

It is recommended that you run a python version above 3.0. 
You can download the required python version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Use these recommended steps to set up your local machine for this project:

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment :** <br />This will isolate the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts.<br />Choose any of the line of code that will work on your local machine.

            python3 -m venv venv
            python -m venv venv


2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment :**<br />This will ensure that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the created isolated environment.

            - for windows : 
                         venv\Scripts\activate

            - for Linux & MacOS :
                         source venv/bin/activate


3. **Upgrade Pip :**<br />Pip is the installed libraries/packages manager. Upgrading Pip will give an to up-to-date version that will work correctly.

            python -m pip install --upgrade pip


4. **Install the required libraries/packages :**<br />There are libraries and packages that are required for this project. These libraries and packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.<br />The text file will allow you to import these libraries and packages into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

            python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
